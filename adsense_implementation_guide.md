The following strategic ad placements have been implemented:

| Placement Name | Position | Target Pages | Device Display | Priority |
|----------------|----------|--------------|----------------|----------|
| Header Banner | Top of page | All pages | All devices | High |

| Sidebar | Right sidebar | Job listings, job details | Desktop only | Medium |
| Job Listing | Between job listings | Job search results | All devices | High |
| Job Detail | Below job description | Job detail page | All devices | High |
| Footer | Bottom of page | All pages | All devices | Low |

## Ad Placement Strategy

### Home Page
- **Header Banner**: Placed at the top of the page for maximum visibility
- **Between Categories**: Strategic placement between category navigation and job listings
- **Native Ad Jobs**: Sponsored job listings mixed with regular job listings
- **Footer Banner**: Less intrusive ad at the bottom of the page
- **Mobile Bottom**: Fixed position at bottom of screen on mobile devices

### Job Listing Page
- **Sidebar**: Persistent sidebar ad that scrolls with the user
- **Top of Search Results**: Highly visible placement above search results
- **Between Job Listings**: Ads inserted after every 3-4 job listings
- **Native Job Ads**: Sponsored job listings mixed with regular listings
- **Below Pagination**: Ad placed near pagination controls for visibility
- **Mobile Bottom**: Fixed position at bottom of screen on mobile devices

### Job Detail Page
- **Sidebar**: Persistent sidebar ad that scrolls with the user
- **Below Job Description**: Prominent placement after users read job details
- **After Application Section**: Strategic high-conversion placement
- **Related Jobs Section**: Ad mixed with related job recommendations
- **Mobile Top Ad**: Mobile-specific placement for better visibility

## Technical Implementation

The ad implementation uses Django template tags to render ads dynamically based on placement position:

```python
# Example usage in templates
{% load adsense %}
{% render_ad 'position_name' %}
```

Ad placements are defined in the database and managed through Django models:

```python
# Model structure in jobs/models.py
class AdPlacement(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    position = models.CharField(max_length=50, unique=True)
    ad_code = models.TextField()
    is_active = models.BooleanField(default=True)
    display_order = models.IntegerField(default=0)
    target_devices = models.CharField(
        max_length=20,
        choices=[('all', 'All Devices'), ('desktop', 'Desktop Only'), ('mobile', 'Mobile Only')],
        default='all'
    )
```

## Mobile Optimization

Mobile-specific ad placements have been implemented to ensure optimal performance on smaller screens:

1. **Responsive Ad Units**: All ad units use responsive sizing to adapt to different screen sizes
2. **Mobile-Specific Placements**: Certain ads only display on mobile devices (mobile_bottom)
3. **Device Detection**: Backend logic detects user device type and serves appropriate ads
4. **Fixed-Position Mobile Ads**: Strategic fixed-position ads for mobile users

## Ad Performance Enhancement

To maximize ad performance, the following enhancements have been implemented:

1. **Visual Attention Cues**: Subtle borders, background colors, and labels help draw attention to ads
2. **Strategic Positioning**: Ads are placed at natural reading break points and high-engagement areas
3. **Scroll Tracking**: JavaScript monitors scroll depth to show ads at optimal moments
4. **Hover Effects**: Subtle hover effects enhance ad visibility and engagement
5. **A/B Testing Ready**: Structure supports easy A/B testing of different ad placements

## Compliance and Best Practices

The implementation adheres to Google AdSense policies and best practices:

1. **Clear Ad Labeling**: All ads are clearly labeled as "Sponsored" or "Con»õinut sponsorizat"
2. **GDPR Compliance**: Consent notice for personalized ads for EU visitors
3. **Ad Density**: Appropriate ad-to-content ratio to avoid policy violations
4. **Staff Exclusion**: Ads are not shown to staff members to avoid accidental clicks
5. **Responsive Design**: All ad units adapt to various screen sizes and devices

## Maintenance and Updates

### Adding New Ad Placements

To add a new ad placement:

1. Add the placement to `jobs/fixtures/ad_placements.json`
2. Run `python manage.py loaddata jobs/fixtures/ad_placements.json`
3. Add the placement tag `{% render_ad 'new_position' %}` in the appropriate template

### Updating Existing Ad Codes

To update ad codes for existing placements:

1. Access the Django admin panel
2. Navigate to "Ad Placements"
3. Select the placement to edit
4. Update the ad code field
5. Save changes

### Testing Ad Performance

For optimal performance:

1. Use Google AdSense reporting to monitor CTR and revenue by placement
2. Consider implementing A/B testing for important placements
3. Regularly review ad positioning based on heatmap data
4. Adjust placement strategies based on seasonal traffic patterns
